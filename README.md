A brain tumour is a collection of tissue that has been pre arranged by the gradual addition of abnormal
cells. It happens when cells in the brain shape irregular formations. It has recently become a leading
cause of death for many people. Since brain tumours are among the most dangerous of all cancers,
prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed to save a life. Because of the development of tumour cells,
detecting these cells is a challenging task. It is critical to equate the treatment of a brain tumour with
that of an MRI. There are three types of brain tumours namely Glioma,Pituitary,Meningioma.Neural
Network is used to classify the tumor.Basically MRI images of different type of tumor is given as
input to the system on which the system is trained and input images are taken to test the model.
One of the most important things for a doctor to do before starting treatment is to detect a tumour.
Traditionally, tumours were discovered by drilling a hole in the skull and removing a small part of
the tumour to inspect. [2]Detection has become easier with the help of machine learning and MRI
images. The system is given MRI images of patients, and it performs detection and classification on
the given set of images. There are numerous algorithms available for this task. In this paper, some
techniques for detecting and classifying brain tumours are discussed. Our system accepts brain MRI
images as input.The main goal is to provide doctors with a high[2] - precision system for classifying
tumour types.Feature extraction by using the Keras and Sequential model is used as we would be
having only one input image and the output would be given so we preferred using Sequential Model.
CNN is used to classify brain tumours into stages automatically. The brain tumour spread area is
detected as well as segmented using the K-means clustering algorithm.. Numbers of defect cells are
found in the spreaded region. This paper concentrates on detecting and classifying the types of tumor
if no tumor is detected it is given as output to the user as no tumor was detected and if tumor is
detected the user would get an output displaying the type of tumor along with the images.[4] The
main goal is to provide doctors with a high - precision system for classifying tumour types.
